## Quick Reference

### Generate Reports
```typescript
const generator = new PDFReportGenerator();
await generator.saveReportToFile(report, 'pdf'); // or 'html'
```

### Setup New Environment
```bash
npm run setup  # Complete setup with all dependencies
```

### Switch Clusters
```typescript
import { clusterManager } from '@/utils/cluster-config';
clusterManager.setCluster('devnet');
```

Or use the dropdown in the frontend header to switch clusters visually.
