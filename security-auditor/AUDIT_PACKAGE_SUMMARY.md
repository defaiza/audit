# DEFAI Security Audit Package
**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Prepared for:** Security Auditors

## Overview
This package contains the complete source code and build artifacts for the DEFAI protocol smart contracts ready for security audit.

## Programs Included

### 1. defai_swap (734KB)
- **Purpose:** Token swap program handling OLD DEFAI to NEW DEFAI conversions with bonus NFT minting
- **Key Features:**
  - Tax mechanism with progressive rates
  - Bonus system with randomness
  - Vesting for bonus tokens
  - OG tier 0 special handling
  - Admin controls with timelock

### 2. defai_estate (662KB)
- **Purpose:** Real estate tokenization and management
- **Key Features:**
  - Estate creation and management
  - Share distribution
  - Joint account integration
  - Metadata handling

### 3. defai_staking (400KB)
- **Purpose:** Token staking program with rewards
- **Key Features:**
  - Stake/unstake functionality
  - Reward distribution
  - Lock periods
  - APR calculations

### 4. defai_app_factory (373KB)
- **Purpose:** Factory for creating DeFAI applications
- **Key Features:**
  - Application deployment
  - Template management
  - Permission controls

## Files Provided

### Source Code
- `/defai_app_factory/` - Complete source code
- `/defai_estate/` - Complete source code
- `/defai_staking/` - Complete source code
- `/defai_swap/` - Complete source code with recent escrow seed fix

### Build Artifacts
- `/target/deploy/*.so` - Compiled program binaries
- `/target/deploy/*-keypair.json` - Program keypairs
- `/target/idl/*.json` - Interface Definition Language files

### Configuration
- `Cargo.toml` - Workspace configuration
- `Cargo.lock` - Dependency lock file
- `Anchor.toml` - Anchor framework configuration

## Recent Changes
1. **Escrow seed construction fix** in defai_swap program:
   - Fixed escrow PDA seed array construction from `&[b"escrow", &[bump]]` to proper format
   - This fix ensures proper signer seed generation for CPI calls

2. **Clarified separation between OG Tier 0 and Airdrop claims**:
   - `swap_og_tier0_for_pnft_v6`: For MAY20DEFAIHolders.csv - Mints NFT + 1:1 vesting from Quantity column
   - `claim_airdrop`: For 10_1AIR-Sheet1.csv - NO NFT, only vesting from AIRDROP column
   - Added clear documentation distinguishing these two separate distribution mechanisms
   - See AIRDROP_SEPARATION_FIX.md for detailed explanation

## Build Status
All programs compile successfully with `anchor build`. The binaries in `/target/deploy/` are the latest builds incorporating all fixes.

## Audit Focus Areas

### Critical Security Points
1. **defai_swap**: Tax calculation logic, bonus randomness, vesting mechanisms
2. **defai_estate**: Access control for estate management, share calculations
3. **defai_staking**: Reward calculations, stake/unstake edge cases
4. **All programs**: PDA derivations, authority checks, arithmetic operations

### Known Considerations
- Uses Token-2022 for enhanced token features
- Implements progressive tax system in swap program
- Contains admin functions with timelock protections
- Uses on-chain randomness (consider VRF integration for production)

## Testing
The programs can be tested using:
```bash
anchor test
```

## Contact
For any questions or clarifications during the audit, please reach out to the development team.
